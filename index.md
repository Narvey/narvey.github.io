I'm not using Github Pages anymore because deployments are a little slow, but mainly unclear as to when they will be done. [Stackbit](https://app.stackbit.com/) does a much better job, here's my site that uses that: https://nobler-and-curiouser.netlify.com/

You can also have a look at [my GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Narvey) or [CodeSandbox profile](https://codesandbox.io/u/Narvey/sandboxes)
