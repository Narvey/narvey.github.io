#### Under the Hood Stuff #####

# Use rdiscount as the markdown engine because it generates html5 compliant code for stuff like footnotes

# If you don't have it install it via gem install rdiscount
markdown: rdiscount

# How many articles do you wish to appear on the front page:
# paginate: 3

# Exclude metadata and development time dependencies (like Grunt plugins)
exclude: [LICENSE, README.markdown, package.json, node_modules]
